# Notes
Here you'll find Markdown Notes & Python Executables from my learning on the [HuggingFaceNLPandLLMcourse](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter2/2)
I apologize for my poor use of Markdown.
I did it in .ipynb because (HugoMautner)[https://github.com/hugomautner] LOVES them so much.
